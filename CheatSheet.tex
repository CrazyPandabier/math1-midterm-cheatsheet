\subsection*{Guidelines for finding a particular solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If f (t) is a polynomial in t, and r = 0 is not a solution of the
    characteristic polynomial, then try for yp(t) a polynomial in t of
    the same degree as f . If r = 0 is a solution of the characteristic
    equation, then try for yp(t) a polynomial of degree deg(f ) + 1,
    if r = 0 is a zero of multiplicity 1, and a polynomial of degree
    deg(f ) + 2 if r = 0 is a zero of multiplicity 2.
    \item If f (t) is of the form
    $f (t) = \alpha sin(\omega_0t) + \beta cos(\omega_0t)$,
    and $\pm i\omega_0$ are not the zeros of the characteristic equation, then
    try
    $yp(t) = A sin(\omega_0t) + B cos(\omega_0t)$
    as particular solution. If $\pm i\omega_0$ are the zeros of the characteristic
    equation, then try
    $yp(t) = At sin(\omega_0t) + Bt cos(\omega_0t)$
    as particular solution
    \item If f (t) is of the form
    $f (t) = p(t) * e^{\alpha t}$,
    with p(t) a polynomial in t, and if $\alpha$ is not a zero of the
    characteristic equation, then try
    $yp(t) = q(t) * e^{\alpha t}$
    as particular solution, with q(t) a polynomial in t of the same
    degree as p(t). If $\alpha$ is a zero of the characteristic polynomial of
    multiplicity k, then try
    $yp(t) = q(t) * t^{k} * e^{\alpha t}$
    as particular solution, with q(t) a polynomial in t, with
    deg(q) = deg(p).
